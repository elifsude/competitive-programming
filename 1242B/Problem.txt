Ujan has a lot of useless stuff in his drawers, a considerable part of which are his math notebooks: it is time to sort them out. This time he found an old dusty graph theory notebook with a description of a graph.

It is an undirected weighted graph on n
 vertices. It is a complete graph: each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The weight of each edge is either 0
 or 1
; exactly m
 edges have weight 1
, and all others have weight 0
.

Since Ujan doesn't really want to organize his notes, he decided to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph. (The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of all its edges.) Can you find the answer for Ujan so he stops procrastinating?

Input
The first line of the input contains two integers n
 and m
 (1≤n≤105
, 0≤m≤min(n(n−1)2,105)
), the number of vertices and the number of edges of weight 1
 in the graph.

The i
-th of the next m
 lines contains two integers ai
 and bi
 (1≤ai,bi≤n
, ai≠bi
), the endpoints of the i
-th edge of weight 1
.

It is guaranteed that no edge appears twice in the input.

Output
Output a single integer, the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph.
