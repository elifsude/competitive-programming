F1. Tree Cutting (Easy Version)
time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given an undirected tree of n
 vertices.

Some vertices are colored blue, some are colored red and some are uncolored. It is guaranteed that the tree contains at least one red vertex and at least one blue vertex.

You choose an edge and remove it from the tree. Tree falls apart into two connected components. Let's call an edge nice if neither of the resulting components contain vertices of both red and blue colors.

How many nice edges are there in the given tree?

Input
The first line contains a single integer n
 (2≤n≤3⋅105
) — the number of vertices in the tree.

The second line contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (0≤ai≤2
) — the colors of the vertices. ai=1
 means that vertex i
 is colored red, ai=2
 means that vertex i
 is colored blue and ai=0
 means that vertex i
 is uncolored.

The i
-th of the next n−1
 lines contains two integers vi
 and ui
 (1≤vi,ui≤n
, vi≠ui
) — the edges of the tree. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. It is guaranteed that the tree contains at least one red vertex and at least one blue vertex.

Output
Print a single integer — the number of nice edges in the given tree.
